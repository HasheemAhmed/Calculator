# Java Calculator Project 📱🧮

## Overview 🌟

This is a simple calculator application implemented in Java. It includes both frontend and backend components and is built using Apache NetBeans. The calculator can evaluate mathematical expressions provided as strings, by using `StringCalculator` class.

## String Calculator Class ✨
   - Takes a string and return the result
   - use stack mechanism to calculate string
   - This class is user defined class made by me

## Features ✨

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Evaluates mathematical expressions provided as strings.
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Built using Apache NetBeans.

## Project Structure 📁

The project files are organized as follows:

- `Calculator.form`: NetBeans form file for the calculator GUI.
- `Calculator.java`: Main class for the calculator application.
- `StringCalculator.java`: Class responsible for evaluating mathematical expressions.
